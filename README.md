# FastAPI REST API Template

Welcome to the FastAPI REST API Template repository. This project is a starting point for building robust and scalable REST APIs using the FastAPI Python framework.

## Features

This template includes the following key features:

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.
- **PostgreSQL**: An open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.
- **SQLAlchemy**: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for Python, providing a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns.
- **Alembic**: A database migrations tool for SQLAlchemy which offers version control for your database schema.
- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.
- **Automatic Documentation Generation**: Using FastAPI, the project includes automatic generation of OpenAPI and JSON Schema documentation.
- **Error Handlers**: Built-in handlers for managing errors and exceptions, ensuring a consistent response format.
- **API Rate Limits**: To prevent abuse, rate limiting is applied to the API endpoints.
